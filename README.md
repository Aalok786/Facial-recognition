# Facial recognition
 Made this project with some help in my first year as a science project to replace the old paper pen attendance system in technical colleges. we can connect this system to cameras present in every classroom, and whenever someone from from administration wants to take the attendance of the whole classroom, just a click and done!!

Required libraries:


cmake
os
datetime
pandas
face-recognition-models
moviepy
numpy
opencv-python

"Training_images" Folder will contain the pictures of students from all angles as much as you can do to recognise them from any angle. I am putting some of mine and roomies photos for demo of mine.
